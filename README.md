# CitySense
 IoT project for university

 We're developing a system that's able to manage a gated community in some of it's sides.
 More specifically our system will manage:

    - Trash collection when the Trash can of a house gets too full (from 75% on).

    - Street lights will power up at dusk.

    - Residents will be able to open the gates with a web-interface
      wich will be only accessible by people on the same subnet of the community.

    - The residents will be alerted by a mini-meteo station when the temperatures
      are too high or too low and the messagge will suggest things related to the 
      temps like wearing a coat when it's cold or to drink more when it's too hot.

This is a project for an IoT class final exam.
